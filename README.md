## Overview

**StudyShore** is an innovative tool designed to transform study materials using generative AI. Developed for the DiamondHacks competition, where we proudly secured 3rd place, StudyShore helps streamline the creation of study aids by converting various media formats into comprehensive study materials.

## Features

- **Versatile Input Processing**: Convert videos, audio files, and text documents (PDF, Word, PowerPoint) into detailed summaries.
- **Interactive Study Tools**: Generate flashcards, quizzes, and get immediate feedback to enhance learning.
- **Export & Share**: Export study materials into Word documents or share links directly.
- **Wide Topic Coverage**: Effective for a range of subjects, with proven success in mathematics and computer science.

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: Upload videos, audio, or text documents.
2. **AI Conversion**: Generate summaries using the Gemini API, process media with GCP's speech-to-text.
3. **Study Materials**: Create flashcards and quizzes for review.
4. **Export & Share**: Download or share study materials.
